Spacecraft propulsion systems are continuously under development to improve efficiency of fuel and to bring new

  <h4 id="Chemical and Ion Propulsion">Chemical and ion propulsion</h4>
  <p class="ex1" id="Analysis_InText">
    Chemical propulsion uses chemical reactions to propel a rocket. This reaction happens between a fuel and an
    oxidizer which produces heat that causes a propellant to expand and according to newtons third law the force
    of the propellant being pushed out will be equal to the thrust the rocket receives to accelerate it <a href="#References">(Vaidya, 2023)</a>.
    An advantage of this method of propulsion is that it is powerful and can overcome earth’s gravity, but it has
    quite a low fuel efficiency of about 30% <a href="#References">(Vaidya, 2023)</a>. Secondly due to the nature of space travel being over
    large distances huge amounts of combustible fuel are needed which is not only expensive (due to its relatively low
    fuel efficiency) but requires the primary and secondary phase vehicles to be large <a href="#References">(Vaidya, 2023)</a>. This is why
    research is being done into other means of propulsion such as ion propulsion.  In simple terms this works by having
    a neutral gas bombarded with electrons to create charged ions <a href="#References">(Vaidya, 2023)</a>. The charged particles accelerate
    towards the ‘grid’ which has a potential difference and due to the current a force is exerted on them consequently
    providing the thrust for propulsion <a href="#References">(Vaidya, 2023)</a>. This method has a 90% fuel efficiency which is much better
    than chemical propulsion however the force produced is relatively low and is not enough yet to overcome earth’s
    gravity <a href="#References">(Vaidya, 2023)</a>.
  </p>

  <h4 id="Nuclear Thermal Propulsion">Nuclear Thermal propulsion</h4>
    <p class="ex1" id="Nuclear_InText">
    Another type of propulsion development is nuclear thermal propulsion. This provides twice the propellant efficiency
    of chemical rockets <a href="#References">(NASA 2025)</a>. This means that less fuel needs to be taken therefore decreasing size and mass of
    payload meaning more essential supplies can be brought along. It works by using nuclear fission and the heat generated
    by it is transferred to the propellant which then expands to be propelled out of the nozzle of the spacecraft giving
    it lift <a href="#References">(NASA 2025)</a>. Research into nuclear thermal propulsion includes the rover/NERVA program that began in the
    mid-fifties and ended in 1973 <a href="#References">(Buden 1988)</a>. During this time 22 reactors were built and tested with different materials.
    For example, It was found that adding zirconium hydride as a moderator into a highly enriched uranium core meant that
    the total mass of the system could be decreased as seen in the Pewee reactor <a href="#References">(National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
    and Medicine 2021)</a>. This can be seen in some of the sampling data from reactor and engine tests as shown below. It shows
    how the Pewee reactor maintained the highest propellant temperature of 2550 (kelvin) for the longest amount of time
    (875 seconds) which demonstrates a higher burning rate of the fuel meaning an increased performance of the engine.

 <h4 id="The Cryogenic Engine">The Cryogenic Engine</h4>
  <p class="ex1" id="Cryogenic_InText">
  A key development of spacecraft propulsion efficiency is the introduction of the cryogenic engine. This engine works by
  storing fluids at low temperatures, so they are in liquid form, but are gaseous at room temperature <a href="#References">(Kitsche 2011)</a>. This
  type of engine looks to be a promising for single stage to orbit flight according to a study and works with a combination
  of an air breathing mode and a cryogenic mode <a href="#References">(Mavapoyil and Kuzhiveli 2025)</a>. The air breathing mode takes place at the
  beginning of flight where oxygen is used for combustion and then switches to cryogenic mode once a predetermined velocity
  and altitude has been reached <a href="#References">(Mavapoyil and Kuzhiveli 2025)</a>. As the engine uses multiple types of propulsion it can
  achieve a higher cost to weight ratio and also reduces space debris which is an environmental benefit <a href="#References">(Mavapoyil and Kuzhiveli 2025)</a>.
  Compared to regular chemical propulsion this looks like a much more sustainable and efficient means of propulsion however
  it is still only in the development stage. 
  </p>

<h4 id="Laser Propulsion: The Breakthrough Starshot Project">Laser Propulsion: The Breakthrough Starshot Project</h4>
    <p class="ex1" id="Starshot_InText">
  Deep space exploration sees many new possibilities due to these advancements because of increased fuel efficiency which
  results in less weight in fuel carried. Potential to visit neighbouring solar systems has also become investigated due to
  the breakthrough Starshot project. This project aims to send gram scale spacecraft to neighbouring solar systems by laser
  propulsion accelerating nano spacecraft to 20% of the speed of light <a href="#References">(Peretz and more 2022)</a>. According to Abbas research
  is still ongoing to find an efficient propellant for space flight missions showing that this is still a very new development
  and that deep space exploration is still very limited for now <a href="#References">(Abbas and more 2025)</a>.  
    </p>

<hr><h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3><hr>
    <p class="ex1" id="Conclusion_InText">
  In conclusion the evolution of spacecraft propulsion systems seems to be heading in the direction of leaving chemical propulsion
  behind and moving to systems that have a more efficient usage of fuel such as ion propulsion. The main parts of the developments
  are to decrease fuel load to give space for other mission essentials. Finally, evolution of systems still has not brought us in
  to deep space exploration yet due to the ideas for it being in early development leaving things like travel to neighbouring
  stars only achievable in the future.

    <h4 id="The Cryogenic Engine">The Cryogenic Engine</h4>
    <p id="Cryogenic_InText"> A key development of spacecraft propulsion efficiency is the introduction of the cryogenic engine. This engine works by
  storing fluids at low temperatures, so they are in liquid form, but are gaseous at room temperature <a href="#References">(Kitsche 2011)</a>. This
  type of engine looks to be a promising for single stage to orbit flight according to a study and works with a combination
  of an air breathing mode and a cryogenic mode <a href="#References">(Mavapoyil and Kuzhiveli 2025)</a>. The air breathing mode takes place at the
  beginning of flight where oxygen is used for combustion and then switches to cryogenic mode once a predetermined velocity
  and altitude has been reached <a href="#References">(Mavapoyil and Kuzhiveli 2025)</a>. As the engine uses multiple types of propulsion it can
  achieve a higher cost to weight ratio and also reduces space debris which is an environmental benefit <a href="#References">(Mavapoyil and Kuzhiveli 2025)</a>.
  Compared to regular chemical propulsion this looks like a much more sustainable and efficient means of propulsion however
  it is still only in the development stage. </p>

  <h4 id="Laser Propulsion: The Breakthrough Starshot Project">Laser Propulsion: The Breakthrough Starshot Project</h4>
  <p id="Starshot_InText"> Deep space exploration sees many new possibilities due to these advancements because of increased fuel efficiency which
  results in less weight in fuel carried. Potential to visit neighbouring solar systems has also become investigated due to
  the breakthrough Starshot project. This project aims to send gram scale spacecraft to neighbouring solar systems by laser
  propulsion accelerating nano spacecraft to 20% of the speed of light <a href="#References">(Peretz and more 2022)</a>. According to Abbas research
  is still ongoing to find an efficient propellant for space flight missions showing that this is still a very new development
  and that deep space exploration is still very limited for now <a href="#References">(Abbas and more 2025)</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p id="Conclusion_InText"> In conclusion the evolution of spacecraft propulsion systems seems to be heading in the direction of leaving chemical propulsion
  behind and moving to systems that have a more efficient usage of fuel such as ion propulsion. The main parts of the developments
  are to decrease fuel load to give space for other mission essentials. Finally, evolution of systems still has not brought us in
  to deep space exploration yet due to the ideas for it being in early development leaving things like travel to neighbouring
  stars only achievable in the future.</p>
